# Pizza Maker
Let's bake some pizza. Customers order pizzas and wait for it.
 
## Making process
The sequential order of the pizza production process comprises 4 steps.
Each production step requires some time (in milliseconds) to finish.
A customer submits an order and waits for delivery. Once a pizza baker
received an order, he/she prepares the pizza, bakes it, and eventually
checks the quality of the baked product and delivers it.
 
- Receive and process order (1ms)
- Prepare pizza (2ms)
- Bake (5ms)
- Quality check (1ms)
 
I propose the following interfaces:
 
```go
type Order struct {
}
type Pizza struct {
    isBaked bool
}
type Oven interface {
    Bake(unbakedPizza Pizza) Pizza
}
type PizzaBaker interface {
    ProcessOrder() Order
    Prepare(order) *Pizza
    QualityCheck(pizza *Pizza) (*Pizza, error)
}
```
 
## Your Task
 
Implement a prototype and evaluate the performance (pizza throughput and
latency) of your Pizza maker implementation. Please document the 
resources you are using.
You can take as much time as you need to complete the implementation.
Please share your solution using some proper code sharing platform. Once
completed, we will setup a short review meeting and discuss next steps.
If you have any additional questions do not hesitate to contact me.
